### 19 January

Built a proof-of-concept classifier two Random Forrest classifiers; one for dynamic and static signs. Both work relatively well, but there is a challenge in detecting dynamic versus static signs and choosing the correct model.

### 20 January

Following in teh example from the [American Sign Language Detection](https://github.com/ashgadala/american-sign-language-detection#) gathered signs and trained a model using NGT signs. This model works well for static symbols, but generally fails with dynamic signs.

### 21 January

Try to build a simple layer that identifies dynamic/static signs with the goal of then choosing the correct model for inference.
